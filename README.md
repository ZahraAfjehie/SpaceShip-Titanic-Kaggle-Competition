# SpaceShip-Titanic-Kaggle-Competition
This repository contains my personal approach to the Spaceship Titanic Kaggle Challenge. [Full Project](https://github.com/ZahraAfjehie/SpaceShip-Titanic-Kaggle-Competition/blob/main/Kaggle_Titanic_Last.ipynb)

In this Kaggle competition, I tackle the challenge posed by the Spaceship Titanic dataset. The goal is to provide a detailed understanding of my approach and solution to this problem.
As a part of the analysis, I used the dataset's features to uncover relationships among variables, engineer new features, and explore techniques for addressing missing values using data visualizations. 
The aim was to thoroughly understand the features and ensure a clean dataset before building models to predict the "Transported" target variable.

Throughout the competition, I achieved my best submission by employing the GradientBoostingClassifier, conducting extensive experimentation, and attaining an 85% training score with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.1944. Detailed analysis and results can be found in the notebook.
